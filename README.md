# Rethynopathy Diabetic (RD) Classifier - Ensemble CNN
<p align="justify">
Detect the stage of diabetic retinopathy in human retina through fundus images. The dataset that used is from 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection">Kaggle </a>. The total of images we used are 8000 images, which is 6000 for training, 1500 as data validation and 500 for testing. We used several proprocessing method for getting hight performance of our model. Our final model is an ensemble of 3 convolutional neural network model with different convolutional network backbone (DensNet201, InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2). Complete projectwith a simple GUI made with python and PyQt5. Image below show our project framework looks like.
